Slides Notes
Name is Cloudlet AI verse and its a platform for Cloudlet to Launch AI agents. To Showcase first agent Agent Hoopz was launched who is specialised in NBA betting analysis, Billposting in Twitter as well as taking bets for players. Second agent is called Agent High Roller host specialised in Hosting Cloudbet VIPs, providing personalised guidance. Next should explain other possibilities such as how this platform can roll out different agent based on different purposes such as Rolling out and agent targeting IPL who is trained on famous cricket commentators data or some other agents based different use case, promo for certain competitions
Finally explain that agents are the future and for lot of regular tasks such as ordering food, buying products online, booking holidays or even buying crypto, people will be talking to agents by text input or voice instead of interacting clicking through multiple apps or websites
Then explains whats next for this project. Would be to setup MCP and having the ability to keep the model upto date with cloudbet odds and markets as well as the offers, promos and T & C. Finally mention that in this project I have not covered the regulatory and compliance concerns specially functions like giving the ability to openly bet on twitter. Also i have not covered the security and the data security part. Instead my main intention as well as this Hackathon's intention is to show the possibilities of AI for cloudlet and the gambling industry how we can adopt to potential production ready projects.
