# CLOUDBET TERMS & CONDITIONS

## Sportsbook Rules

### General Rules

All bets are subject to these rules. By placing a bet, you agree that you have read, understood, and will abide by these rules.

Cloudbet reserves the right to amend these rules at any time. Any changes will be published on our website and will be effective immediately.

### Bet Settlement

All bets will be settled based on the official result as declared by the governing body responsible for the event. If no official result is declared, bets will be settled based on the result as published on our website.

Bet settlement will normally take place shortly after the event has finished. Cloudbet reserves the right to delay settlement if there is any uncertainty regarding the result.

### Cash Out

Cash Out is a feature that allows you to settle your bet before the event has finished. The Cash Out amount offered will be based on the current market conditions and may be higher or lower than your original stake.

Cash Out is available on selected events and markets. Cloudbet reserves the right to suspend or remove the Cash Out feature at any time, without prior notice.

Cash Out requests are not guaranteed and may be declined if the market suspends or the price changes during the processing of your request.

### Bonus Rules and Playthrough Requirements

Bonuses are subject to a playthrough requirement before any winnings can be withdrawn. The standard playthrough requirement is 5x the bonus amount for sports bets and 30x for casino games, unless otherwise stated.

Sports bets must be placed on events with odds of 1.50 or higher to count towards the playthrough requirement.

Bonus funds will be used before real money when placing bets. If you have active bonus funds, withdrawals will not be processed until the playthrough requirement has been met or the bonus has expired.

### Withdrawal Limitations

Withdrawals are processed within 24 hours, subject to verification procedures.

The minimum withdrawal amount is 0.001 BTC or equivalent in other cryptocurrencies.

There are no maximum withdrawal limits for verified accounts.

Withdrawals may be subject to additional verification if they exceed certain thresholds or trigger security protocols.

## Casino Rules

### General Rules

All casino games are governed by their individual rules which can be accessed within each game.

Cloudbet uses provably fair technology for many games, allowing players to verify the fairness of each game round.

### Game Malfunction

In the event of a game malfunction, any affected bets will be refunded to the player's account.

### Progressive Jackpots

Progressive jackpot wins will be paid out in full, regardless of the size of the jackpot.

### Live Casino

In the event of a disconnect during a live casino game, any bets placed will stand and will be settled based on the outcome of the game.

## Responsible Gambling

Cloudbet is committed to promoting responsible gambling. Players can set deposit limits, loss limits, and self-exclusion periods through their account settings.

Players who believe they may have a gambling problem are encouraged to seek help from professional organizations.

Cloudbet reserves the right to close or restrict accounts if we believe a player is showing signs of problem gambling.
